                            Razorpay is an Indian financial technology company that has made significant strides in the online payment space. Founded in 2014 by Harshil Mathur and Shashank Kumar, Razorpay aimed to simplify online transactions for businesses and consumers alike. Over the years, the company has grown exponentially, becoming one of India's leading payment gateway providers. This case study delves into Razorpay's journey, its innovative offerings, and the impact it has made in the Indian fintech landscape.

                            Before Razorpay entered the scene, online payments in India were riddled with complexities, high transaction failure rates, and limited payment options. Small and medium-sized businesses faced numerous challenges in integrating payment gateways, and customers often experienced frustrating payment experiences.
                            
                            Razorpay's primary challenge was to bridge the gap between traditional payment methods and modern digital transactions while offering a seamless and secure payment experience for businesses and consumers alike.
